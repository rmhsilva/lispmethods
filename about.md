This is a growing collection of articles about (ANSI) Common Lisp, and how to do
useful things with it. I do not intend to convince you that Lisp is a
fundamentally better programming language, or other opinionated nonsense. There
is enough of that spread across the internet already.

However I will not attempt to disguise the fact that **I really enjoy using
Lisp**. In case writing about it didn't make that clear enough.

Any references I make to "Lisp" probably refer to Common Lisp, unless I
explicitly state otherwise. I'm just lazy like that. Also, I usually assume you
are running [SBCL][sbcl].

[sbcl]: http://www.sbcl.org/

Recommended reading for anyone new to Common Lisp:

- [Practical Common Lisp (Peter Seibel)](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)
- [On Lisp (Paul Graham)](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html)
- [Common Lisp Recipes (Edmund Weitz)](http://weitz.de/cl-recipes/)
- and for the really keen, [Let Over Lambda (Doug Hoyte)](http://letoverlambda.com/)

Enjoy!

#### PS:

I assume at least an intermediate level of programming experience (any language
will do) - if you don't know how to open a command prompt, this probably isn't
for you.

Many things I write will probably be wrong. Please educate me.
